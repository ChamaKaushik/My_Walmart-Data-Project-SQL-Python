# Walmart Data Analysis using SQL and Python

## Project Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow focused on uncovering valuable business insights from Walmart's sales data. Using Python, the data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared before being loaded into a relational database. SQL is then used to perform complex queries and answer important business questions. This project is a great hands-on exercise for anyone looking to build practical skills in data analysis, SQL, and working with real-world datasets.
